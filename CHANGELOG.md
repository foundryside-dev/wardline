## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-30

First public release. A generic, lightweight semantic-tainting static analyzer
for Python — enterprise-class trust-boundary analysis at small-team weight.

### Added

- **Taint engine** — AST-based semantic taint analysis with a trust lattice,
  call-graph propagation, function-summary caching, and `match`-statement
  handling. Zero runtime dependencies in the base package.
- **Trust vocabulary** — decorator-based trust markers (`@trusted`,
  `@boundary`, validators) resolved through a configurable vocabulary
  descriptor.
- **Rules** — `PY-WL-101` (untrusted-reaches-trusted), `PY-WL-102`
  (boundary-without-rejection), `PY-WL-103` (broad-except), `PY-WL-104`
  (silent-except), with per-rule severity overrides.
- **Outputs** — `wardline scan` emits findings as JSONL or SARIF, with a native
  Filigree emitter and Clarion producer-conformance support for Loom
  integration.
- **Suppression model** — baseline files and waivers (with expiry), plus an
  opt-in LLM triage layer.
- **LLM triage judge** — opt-in `wardline judge` reads each active finding cold
  and labels it true/false positive with a rationale, writing confirmed
  false positives to `.wardline/judged.yaml`. Dependency-free transport
  (stdlib `urllib` → OpenRouter); requires `WARDLINE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- **Configuration** — `wardline.yaml`, validated fail-loud against a JSON
  Schema (unknown or mistyped keys are hard errors).
- **Packaging** — MIT-licensed; optional extras `scanner` (config + CLI) and
  `loom` (HTTP integrations).
