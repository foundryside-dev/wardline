"""Signed, reproducible evidence bundle (``attest``) — build / sign / verify.

THREAT MODEL — read before trusting a bundle. The signature is **HMAC-SHA256 with
a SHARED PROJECT KEY**. That makes it *tamper-evidence within a key-holding trust
domain* (a CI runner, a team that all hold the same key) — NOT public, asymmetric,
non-repudiable proof. Verification REQUIRES possessing the same secret used to sign;
anyone with the key can both produce and verify a bundle, so it does not bind the
bundle to a specific signer. Asymmetric signing (Ed25519 / RSA) would prove authorship
without sharing a secret, but it needs a non-stdlib dependency, which Wardline's
zero-dependency base forbids — so HMAC is **forced, not chosen**. Do not present a
bundle as cryptographic proof of *who* produced it; it proves only that the holder of
the project key has not been tampered with since signing.

DETERMINISM is a hard requirement. The canonical bytes of ``payload``
(:func:`_canonical_bytes`) are the reproducibility target; the HMAC additionally binds
the outer envelope ``schema`` so a future schema relabel cannot verify against the wrong
wire contract. Two builds of the same unchanged tree at the same ``today`` must produce
byte-identical canonical payloads — the only date-sensitive field is the posture's
waiver-debt ``days_left``, so a waiver-free tree's payload is fully date-independent.
Every list in the payload is sorted on a stable key (boundaries by qualname; the posture
sorts its own lists) so the suite's ``pytest-randomly`` ordering cannot perturb the
bytes.

Zero-dependency: stdlib ``hmac`` / ``hashlib`` / ``subprocess`` / ``json`` only. This
module never imports a third-party EXTRA package (e.g. ``blake3``) at module level —
``import wardline.core.attest`` pulls in no extra dependency. (It DOES reach
``wardline.loomweave.identity`` transitively via ``core.dossier``, but that module is
stdlib-only, so the zero-dependency base holds.) The live Loomweave CLIENT used for SEI
enrichment of the ``boundaries`` entries is opt-in via a ``loomweave_client`` and is
LAZY-imported inside :func:`_enrich_seis`. Without a client every ``sei`` stays None and
``sei_source`` is ``"unavailable"``.

SEI values live in the SIGNED payload, so reproducibility threads the same
``loomweave_client`` through BOTH build and verify: re-verifying a SEI-keyed bundle WITH
the same client (and unchanged tree) reproduces; re-verifying WITHOUT a client honestly
reports ``reproduced=False`` (the SEIs cannot be re-derived) while the signature — which
is over the recorded payload — stays valid.
