Designed as a superset of Filigree's scan-results intake so SP4 emission is
serialization, not translation. Wardline owns the analysis *fact*; finding
*lifecycle* (status, seen_count, issue_id, timestamps) is Filigree's domain

# --- Finding fingerprint (SP2 §7) --------------------------------------------
# Stable cross-run identity. The fingerprint is the cross-tool JOIN KEY: Filigree
# associates issues to it and the baseline/waiver stores key on it, so it MUST be
# invariant to taint-resolution drift — it must not move across builds while the
# source is byte-identical (weft-4a9d0f863c: it moved across three builds because
# resolved taint tiers and ``via_callee`` were folded in, and those legitimately
# change as the rule suite is extended/refined).
#
# INVARIANT (enforce at every call site — see tests/golden/identity): ``taint_path``
# carries ONLY a SOURCE-DERIVED discriminator and exists SOLELY to separate two
# distinct findings that share (rule_id, path, line_start, qualname). A component
# may appear in ``taint_path`` only if it is BOTH (a) derived purely from source
# tokens / lexical position (a sink dotted-name, a callee spelling as written, a
# decorator marker/level token, a call's ``col_offset``) — NOT a resolved
# ``TaintState`` tier and NOT ``via_callee`` — AND (b) load-bearing: actually
# needed to tell two co-located findings apart. A rule that emits at most one
# finding per (rule_id, path, qualname) passes ``taint_path=None``.
# Resolved tiers belong in ``message``/``properties``, never the join key.
# This invariant is no longer convention-only: ``scanner.diagnostics.build_collision_findings``
# enforces it at runtime over the full emitted set (wardline-8fb773a7af) — two DISTINCT
# findings sharing a fingerprint surface a loud WLN-ENGINE-FINGERPRINT-COLLISION DEFECT
# that trips the gate, instead of one silently masking the other on the joins.
#
# ``line_start`` is DELIBERATELY NOT hashed (wlfp2, wardline-8654423823): a benign
# comment above an entity shifts every line below it but is the same source, so it
# must not churn the cross-tool join key. Multi-emit rules therefore discriminate
# co-located findings with an ENTITY-RELATIVE position — ``node.lineno -
# entity.location.line_start`` plus the call's ``col_offset:end_col_offset`` — which
# is invariant to the whole entity moving (a comment above it). NOTE: it is
# entity-relative, NOT move-stable in the strong sense — a comment inserted INSIDE
# the entity above the node still shifts the relative offset (accepted; the contract
# is identical-source -> identical-fingerprint, and that edit is not identical source).
# ``line_start`` remains on ``Finding.location`` for SARIF regions and display.

# lets a store that was written under a different hash formula LOUD-FAIL on load
# (``SchemeMismatchError``) instead of silently joining stale values and
# orphaning every verdict. The IN-MEMORY ``Finding.fingerprint`` stays bare
# 64-hex; the prefix is applied only when serialising to a store/wire and
# stripped (``parse_fingerprint``) when reading one back. ``wlfp1`` is this
# (line_start-IN) formula; the move-stability rekey will bump it to ``wlfp2``.
